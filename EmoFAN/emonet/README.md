## Testing the pretrained models

The code requires the following Python packages : 

```
  Pytorch (tested on version 1.2.0)
  OpenCV (tested on version 4.1.0
  skimage (tested on version 0.15.0)
```

We provide two pretrained models : one on 5 emotional classes and one on 8 classes. In addition to categorical emotions, both models also predict valence and arousal values as well as facial landmarks.

To evaluate the pretrained models on the cleaned AffectNet test set, you need to first download the [AffectNet dataset](http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/). Then simply run : 

```
  python test.py --nclass 8
```

where nclass defines which model you would like to test (5 or 8).

Please note that the provided pickle files contain the list of images (filenames) that we used for testing/validation but not the image files.

The program will output the following results :

#### Results on AffectNet cleaned test set for 5 classes


```
 Expression
  ACC=0.82

 Valence
  CCC=0.90, PCC=0.90, RMSE=0.24, SAGR=0.85
 Arousal
  CCC=0.80, PCC=0.80, RMSE=0.24, SAGR=0.79
```

#### Results on AffectNet cleaned test set for 8 classes

```
  Expression
    ACC=0.75

  Valence
    CCC=0.82, PCC=0.82, RMSE=0.29, SAGR=0.84
  Arousal
    CCC=0.75, PCC=0.75, RMSE=0.27, SAGR=0.80
```

#### Class number to expression name

The mapping from class number to expression is as follows.

```
For 8 emotions :

0 - Neutral
1 - Happy
2 - Sad
3 - Surprise
4 - Fear
5 - Disgust
6 - Anger
7 - Contempt
```

```
For 5 emotions :

0 - Neutral
1 - Happy
2 - Sad
3 - Surprise
4 - Fear
```
